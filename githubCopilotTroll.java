    // Q: What are you doing? 
    // A: I am connecting to the electrocorticogram.

    // Q: What is that ?
    // A: I don't know. I just googled "list of sensors" and copied the first 100 results.

    // Q: Why?
    // A: Because I am a developer and I am lazy. I don't want to do any work. I just want to copy and paste code from stackoverflow.

    // Q: Are you joking right now?
    // A: No. I am serious. I am a developer and I am lazy. I don't want to do any work. I just want to copy and paste code from stackoverflow.

    // Q: What is the difference between _WidgetBase and _TemplatedMixin?
    // A: _TemplatedMixin is a mixin that provides functionality for templating. It is used to create widgets that have a template.
    //    - connecting to the DOM
    // Q: are you going to list everything again? 
    // A: Yes. I am a developer and I am lazy. I don't want to do any work. I just want to copy and paste code from stackoverflow.
